title: Wiki Guidelines
---

First of all, thank you for your efforts to make this wiki better. Seriously, with a lot of blocks and items it is near to impossible for developers to keep wiki up-to-date.

## Wiki Structure

Wiki content split into several sections:

- **Items** - Tech Reborn items. Including cells, dusts, ingots, parts, etc.
- **Blocks** - Tech Reborn blocks. Including machine frames/casings, storage/tank units, etc.
- **World** - World Generation related things, like ores, trees, NPCs.

## Syntax

This wiki with **Docusaurus** and use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for pages. There is a comprehensive [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) on possible formatting options.

## Page Structure

Pages should start with Front Matter.

```
---
title: <Some page Title. It will become H1 tag on the page and also will be used in SideBar>
sidebar_position: <Some number, including float. Optional. Could be used to better sort pages in SideBar
---
```

More fields for Front Matter documented [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter).

Most of pages have big righ-aligned item image just below page title. We have custom component for that image

```
<ItemImage 
    file="<file name without extension for a file in /static/img/techreborn folder>" 
    alt="<Alt text for image>" 
    size="<Size in pixels for image.>" />
```

Here is an example of ItemImage.
```
<ItemImage file="rubber_sapling" alt="Rubber Sapling" size="200" />
```
will be shown as:

<ItemImage file="rubber_sapling" alt="Rubber Sapling" size="200" />

<div style={{clear: 'both'}} />

Please, use headings to structure page content. Table of Content for a page will be generated automatically based on heading.
