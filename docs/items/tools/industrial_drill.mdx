**Industrial Drill** is the most powerful drill in Tech Reborn. It can do AOE mining in a 3x3 area.

It has 1,000,000 Energy storage. One can charge it using <McItem slug="techreborn:battery_box" inline={true}/> or any other machine capable of charging powered items. Charge rate will be 8192 E\t.

Dig time doesn't depend on the amount of blocks being broken. It is calculated only for the targeted block. The drill will break adjacent blocks if their break time is less than or no more than 10 times harder to break than the target block with a pickaxe or shovel. So if you are hitting <McItem slug="minecraft:sand" inline={true}/>, then **Industrial Drill** will break adjacent <McItem slug="minecraft:stone" inline={true}/>, but not <McItem slug="minecraft:obsidian" inline={true}/>.

3x3 AoE mining is activated by Sneak & Right Click at the same time. **Industrial Drill** will mine in regular 1x1 mode while inactive. It will cost 150 Energy to break one block.
