# UU-Matter

**UU-Matter** is an item added by Tech Reborn. It is produced when the <McItem slug="techreborn:matter_fabricator" /> is provided with adequate power and <McItem slug="techreborn:scrap_box" /> or optionally <McItem slug="techreborn:scrap" />.

UU-Matter can be used to craft a variety of materials, or can be put in a <McItem slug="techreborn:fluid_replicator" /> to replicate fluids.

Recipes producing Orecs and using Stone can also use Deepslate instead.
