![Industrial Drill](/media/mods/techreborn/industrial_drill.png){.align-right width="200" query="?nolink&200"} =======Industrial Drill======= **Industrial Drill** is a most powerful drill in Tech Reborn. It can do AOE mining in 3x3 area.

It has 1.000.000 Energy storage. One can charge it using \<mcitem\>techreborn:battery_box\</mcitem\> or any other machine capable of charging powered items. Charge rate will be 8192 E\\t.

Dig time doesn't depend on amount of blocks being broken. It is calculated only for targeted block. Drill will break adjacent blocks if their break time less or no more than 10 times harder to break target block with pickaxe or shovel. So if you are hitting \<mcitem\>minecraft:sand\</mcitem\> then **Industrial Drill** will break adjacent \<mcitem\>minecraft:stone\</mcitem\>, but not \<mcitem\>minecraft:obsidian\</mcitem\>.

3x3 AoE mining activated by Sneak & Right Click at the same time. **Industrial Drill** will mine in regular 1x1 mode while Inactive. It will cost 150 Energy to break one block.
