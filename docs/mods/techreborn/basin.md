# Basin

The **Basin** is a simple automation tool that is used to gather the \<mcitem\>techreborn:sap\</mcitem\> from \<mcitem\>techreborn:rubber_tree\</mcitem\>s. In order to use the \<mcitem\>techreborn:Basin\</mcitem\>, you must place it directly onto a \<mcitem\>techreborn:rubber_tree\</mcitem\>. It will then begin harvesting any sap directly above, on, or below the log it's currently attached to.

It has an internal buffer of one harvest[^1] before becoming full. The sap can be withdrawn by placing a storage container underneath(chest, storage unit, etc) the \<mcitem\>techreborn:basin\</mcitem\>. It has a 40% chance to yield two sap instead of one.

The basin does not require an energy source.

\<callout type="info" title="Note"\> The \<mcitem\>techreborn:basin\</mcitem\> does not increase the spawn rate of the rubber on the tree - it simply acts as a basic form to automate the collection of rubber instead of manually tapping. In a sense, it's meant to be a set-and-forget type of machine. \</callout\>

## Yield

An approximate yield of sap using a \<mcitem\>techreborn:Basin\</mcitem\> is 1.` <overline style="text-decoration:overline">5</overline>`{=html} sap/hour/tree (using one \<mcitem\>techreborn:Basin\</mcitem\> on each of the four sides of the tree).

This test was performed by attaching a Basin to each side of 9 rubber trees and placing chests beneath each \<mcitem\>techreborn:basin\</mcitem\>. The player then went \<tooltip title="away from keyboard"\>AFK\</tooltip\> for approximately 60 minutes, after which they gathered the sap from all the chests. The total amount of sap gathered was 56.

This experiment was only run once with a small sample size to give a rough estimate - your results may vary.

This test was run on Minecraft 1.16.5 \| Techreborn v3.8.4 Build 236.

## Version Notes

Introduced in the 1.16 version of Tech Reborn

[^1]: Editor's Note: this amount is unclear, but I take it to mean one individual piece of \<mcitem\>techreborn:sap\</mcitem\>.
