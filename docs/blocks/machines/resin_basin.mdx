The **Resin Basin** is a machine which will automatically gather sap from Rubber Trees.


The **Resin Basin** is a simple automation tool that is used to gather the <McItem slug="techreborn:sap" /> from <McItem slug="techreborn:rubber_tree" />s. 
In order to use the **Resin Basin**, you must place it directly onto a <McItem slug="techreborn:rubber_tree"/>. 
It will then begin harvesting any sap directly above, on, or below the log it's currently attached to.

It has an internal buffer of one harvest[^1] before becoming full. The sap can be withdrawn by placing a storage container underneath(chest, storage unit, etc) the **Resin Basin**. 
It has a 40% chance to yield two sap instead of one.

The basin does not require an energy source.

:::note

The **Resin Basin** does not increase the spawn rate of the rubber on the tree - it simply acts as a basic form to automate the collection of rubber instead of manually tapping. 
In a sense, it's meant to be a set-and-forget type of machine.

## Yield

An approximate yield of sap using a **Resin Basin** is 1. ~5 sap/hour/tree (using one **Resin Basin** on each of the four sides of the tree).

This test was performed by attaching a **Resin Basin** to each side of 9 rubber trees and placing chests beneath each **Resin Basin**. 
The player then went AFK for approximately 60 minutes, after which they gathered the sap from all the chests. The total amount of sap gathered was 56.

This experiment was only run once with a small sample size to give a rough estimate - your results may vary.

This test was run on Minecraft 1.16.5 | Techreborn v3.8.4 Build 236.

## Version Notes

Introduced in the 1.16 version of Tech Reborn

[^1]: Editor's Note: this amount is unclear, but I take it to mean one individual piece of <McItem slug="techreborn:sap"/>.
