# Elevator

Players can teleport in vertical elevator blocks.

By default, the elevator can pass through other blocks and can be adjusted through configuration files.

The elevator block needs two blocks of space above it to be considered valid.

There is a known conflict with other mods if they mess with player movement. It should be fixed in recent Tech Reborn versions.
