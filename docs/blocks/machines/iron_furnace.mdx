An **Iron Furnace** works much like a traditional <McItem slug="minecraft:furnace" />, except that it is 56.25% more efficient with the fuel you use. 
You can see in the below recipes that both use the same amount of fuel, but the <McItem slug="techreborn:iron_furnace" /> produced an extra 9 ingots compared to the traditional <McItem slug="minecraft:furnace" />.

For example:

16x <McItem slug="minecraft:iron_ingot" /> + 2x <McItem slug="minecraft:coal" /> will produce 16x <McItem slug="techreborn:refined_iron_ingot" /> in <McItem slug="minecraft:furnace" />

25x <McItem slug="minecraft:iron_ingot" /> + 2x <McItem slug="minecraft:coal" /> will produce 25x <McItem slug="techreborn:refined_iron_ingot" /> in <McItem slug="techreborn:iron_furnace" />
