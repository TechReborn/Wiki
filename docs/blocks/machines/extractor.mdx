The **Extractor** is a machine that is used to process natural resources into another useful product. For example, <McItem slug="techreborn:sap" inline={true}/> into <McItem slug="techreborn:rubber" inline={true}/>.

The **Extractor** requires a power input of 32 E/tick to work and has an internal buffer of 1k E.

The extractor can also be used to discard the contents of a <McItem slug="techreborn:cell" inline={true}/> so that you can use it again.
