## Cables

Cables are used in crafting and to transfer energy. Please, find more details in [Cables](cables) section.

## Generators

<ItemImage file="generator" alt="Generators" size="100" />

There are two major types of generators:

1. Active. They are consume some resources to generate Energy. Building an effective supply chain could be a challenging task. But they are good starting point in most cases.
2. Passive. They do not consume resources to generate Energy. Energy production of basic tier passive generators is not so impressive. But instead of building a supply chain for fuel you can build a bunch of passive generator and just forget about it.

Please, find more details in [Generators](generators) section.
