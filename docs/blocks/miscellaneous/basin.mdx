# Basin

The **Basin** is a simple automation tool that is used to gather the <McItem slug="techreborn:sap" inline={true}/> from <McItem slug="techreborn:rubber_tree" inline={true}/>s. In order to use the <McItem slug="techreborn:Basin" inline={true}/>, you must place it directly onto a <McItem slug="techreborn:rubber_tree" inline={true}/>. It will then begin harvesting any sap directly above, on, or below the log it's currently attached to.

It has an internal buffer of one harvest[^1] before becoming full. The sap can be withdrawn by placing a storage container underneath (chest, storage unit, etc.) the <McItem slug="techreborn:basin" inline={true}/>. It has a 40% chance to yield two sap instead of one.

The Basin does not require an energy source.

:::info Note
The <McItem slug="techreborn:basin" inline={true}/> does not increase the spawn rate of the rubber on the tree — it simply acts as a basic form to automate the collection of rubber instead of manually tapping. In a sense, it's meant to be a set-and-forget type of machine.

## Yield

An approximate yield of sap using a <McItem slug="techreborn:Basin" inline={true}/> is 1.5 sap/hour/tree (using one <McItem slug="techreborn:Basin" inline={true}/> on each of the four sides of the tree).

This test was performed by attaching a Basin to each side of 9 rubber trees and placing chests beneath each <McItem slug="techreborn:basin" inline={true}/>. The player then went <span title="away from keyboard">AFK</span> for approximately 60 minutes, after which they gathered the sap from all the chests. The total amount of sap gathered was 56.

This experiment was only run once with a small sample size to give a rough estimate — your results may vary.

This test was run on Minecraft 1.16.5 | Tech Reborn v3.8.4 Build 236.

## Version Notes

Introduced in the 1.16 version of Tech Reborn

[^1]: Editor's Note: this amount is unclear, but I take it to mean one individual piece of <McItem slug="techreborn:sap" inline={true}/>.
